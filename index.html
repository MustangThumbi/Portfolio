            <div id="int"><h3> Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>I believe machine learning is great.<br> It makes work easier and make on to concentrate on other useful stuff. For instance some boring recurring activities like laundry dishwashing cleaning the house and like.This crap can be done by machine with very low interaction you just programm it and leave the rest for it to do.</p></div>
            <div id="int"><h3> AI</h3>
                <p> AI is kind of tied to Machine leaning. I use Ai in hand with ML every day. <br> For example I have a smart home control system and I just command it to do stuffs. You should try it too.</p>

            <h3>Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Due to climatic changes and global warming some crops tend to become rare.

                <p>Reliable energy is the conerstone of our civilization. From the invetion of the wheel, petrolium products have been of high demand. Given the demand and supply in todays world, it does not meet the optimum point.Low supply with high demand leads to high fuel prices. High fuel prices leads to low economy as many cant afford basic commodity due to inflation.So in persue of green and sustainable energy and save the future generations with reduced co2 gases its a key area of focus</p></div>
